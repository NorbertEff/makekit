# MakeKit CMake file for custom build types
# Keep in mind, that CMake BUILD_TYPEs are case-insensitive, thus
# it doesn't make difference between lowercase and uppercase characters.
# The following build type names are protected by CMake: None, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel.
# You can inherit from another build types by passing its name to mk_add_build_type().
